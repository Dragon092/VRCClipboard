# VRCClipboard

A Melonloader mod for VRChat that allows you to paste links into video players directly from your clipboard.

Currently this mod only works with players that use the VRCUrlInputField component. It has been tested with [USharpVideo](https://github.com/MerlinVR/USharpVideo).
I know that there are worlds with different players that do not work. If you want the mod to work in an unsupported world let me know and I can try to support it.

## Installation

1. Install [VRChatUtilityKit](https://github.com/knah/VRCMods) and [UIExpansionKit](https://github.com/knah/VRCMods)
2. Put the [VRCClipboard.dll](https://github.com/Dragon092/VRCClipboard/releases) from the latest release into your Mods folder
